* **Git:** Version control system to track changes to source code.

* **GitHub:** Hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* **Node.js:** Used for package managment and to execute JavaScript code to build the command line tool for server-side scripting.

* **React** is an open-source, declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Itâ€™s maintained by Facebook, and it can be used to develop of single-page applications (SPA).

* **React Testing Library (@testing-library/react)** offers simple and complete React DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing practices.

* **React Router** is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application, allowing you to make single-page React applications behave more like multi-page applications.

* **MongoDB Atlas:** is a cloud-based database service that's created and maintained by MongoDB. It works with hosting services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to help users provision, maintain, and secure new databases for their applications.

* **The nodemon package** simplifies the development environment by automatically restarting the Node.js applications when file changes in the directory are detected.
